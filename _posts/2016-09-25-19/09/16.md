Today we continued doing what we did last week and going through the book as instructed to do so. Firstly we gathered all the equipment to create the coding software and started. I found this lesson very enjoyable a when we went on and made our coding look better, I felt proud of myself as I felt that I had accomplished something. Also it looked really cool and I was able to play around with the wording of my coding without using the book for help. We then moved on                     

However when we moved on to Project 2 I didn't think we read the instructions thoroughly enough, therefore we made a couple of mistakes allowing there to be errors in our code. This made it impossible to run it. We soon found out what we did wrong and fixed it.

I think this lesson really brought my coding skills on and next week I will be able to do everything smoothly.
