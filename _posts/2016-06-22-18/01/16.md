**_Our Lesson Today_**

For most of the lesson today I was not there as I was at my guitar lesson so I can talk about what we did when I was there. In the first 15 minutes when I was there  we got into groups of three and started answering some questions on both normal media and social media. Sorry about being so brief but that's all the information I can give you guys!
