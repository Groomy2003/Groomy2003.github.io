**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today Mr Keen was absent so we were set some work by our cover teacher. We had to go onto a website called **'Code Combat' **and learnt the basics of coding. This lesson was an introduction of a new topic as there was lots of tutorials and information about coding. This all was very new to me as I had never done any coding before but after a while I soon picked up the coding language and found it very interesting. In this lesson I think I did well in doing what we were meant to be doing all lesson. This was because I knew that I had to get to grips with coding. On the other hand I think I could have worked a bit faster but it was very hard as my keyboard didnâ€™t work! Hopefully Mr Keen will be here next week.
