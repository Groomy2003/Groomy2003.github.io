**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today I was absent and not in school but managed to do the homework that was set. The homework that we had to complete was to interview our parents and these were the three questions that we had to give to them.

1. **What social media sites do you use?**

2. **What do you think others would say about you solely based on what you post online? What would they say about the kind of person you are and what your interests are?**

3. **Is there anything you would want to change about your online identity? Anything you want to share more or less online? If so, why?**

These questions were asked to my dad and I was very embarrassed by his response on the last question! Hopefully I will be there next week and be able to deliver some more information on what we did.
