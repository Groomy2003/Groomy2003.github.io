**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today we were introduced to a coding website call 'microbit'. This website wa designed for creating games (a bit like scratch) but it all had to be in code. We started off by trying to complete the 6 tutorials that had been given to us but they took very long and were very difficult. It was obvious that nobody was going to finish them all off in the lesson so we had to finish them off for homework. To show that we had done it, we would then have to save our code onto Google Docs. I think I persevered with myself really well because at one point I accidently deleted some of my work which really frustrated me.
