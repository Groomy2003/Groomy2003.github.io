**_Our Lesson Today_**

Now that we had finished all of the microbit programming we moved onto fixing our own blogs. Firstly Mr Keen reminded us on a few things about our blogs which were:

1. Make sure you give the correct link for your blog posts.

2. Every week we have to do a **blog post.**

3. Our blog post should not just be what we did in the lesson, it should be what we learnt and about the fabric. (eg. Today we did this ___, I think I did this well ___, I need to work on ____ etc. )

Next we deleted our repo of the 'Barry Clark jekyll now' because it had gone out of date but we replaced it with a newer version. After forking it we edited the details of the original blog and styled it to what we wanted to (eg. bio, colours, fonts etc.) In this lesson I think I was good at taking control of every I do whereas asking numerous people for help a lot. But in this lesson I did not think I followed the instructions at the speed we were meant to do so. This happened because I was being way too picky about the colours and fonts of my blog. This resulted in me playing catch up for some of the lesson. Finally I learnt that the blog I first created was always going to break because the coding for it was too old. Although at the time I did not think it was a good idea to DELETE, my blog I now realise the reason of why I had to.
