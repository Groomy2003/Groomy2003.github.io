    <td>Hi Guys!!
Today I learnt by taking on what our teacher was talking about and using this information to improve my blog (Auditory). I found this very helpful as now my blog looks very good in my eyes.
Get in there!!!!!</td>

    <td>I now regret not taking notesâ€¦ (Idiot). If I had taken notes I would have been able to remember everything Mr Keen said and put it all into my blog. Even those little things that will make it a tiny bit better. But hey, a bit better is better than nothing, Right??
Also I think we could have had some more time at our computers. I mean we are in a Computing Lesson??</td>

    <td>Like I said before, I NEED TO TAKE SOME NOTES!!!! Having these notes will make my blog better, my understanding better etc. Also I need to think a bit harder as when the table coding was put up on Google Classroom (and by the way it has a password so all you hackers out there can think again), I was still copying it off the board instead of copying and pasting it! 
Anyway my next blog will be out on Monday so have a nice time fans and Cyaaa!</td>
