**_Our Lesson Today    _**

Today was my first lesson back after half term as I was not here last week.We first started with filling in a survey about social media and the internet and then moved onto finishing our games. The games that we created could be anything we wanted it to be but it was key to not make it to hard to program in code.       

     We knew exactly what we were going to do at every stage as for last week's homework we had to fill in a planning sheet. My game is a Quiz on the subject of 'Sportâ€™. You have to get 8 points from just 10 questions to regain your title as the World Quiz Master.

    Hopefully after I have finished my code for my game, I will be able to post it onto my blog!!  In our lesson we carried on creating our game of our own choice.
