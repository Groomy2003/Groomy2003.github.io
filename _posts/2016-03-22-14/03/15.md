**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today we looked at prezi and experimented on it ourselves. I found this much easier than Powerpoint or other things like that as it is much more interactive and interesting. Mr Keen showed us a few of his which were extremely good as you never knew what was coming up next. Whether it was zooming inside the letters or zooming out and finding what you had just looked at was all on a computer screen!!!! We either used templates or created our own prezi presentation and learnt how to edit paths and change angles of it. For homework we just carried on with this to get used to it.
