    <td>Just like the same as last week I learnt by using the ideas from the book and putting them into my own work by altering a bit of coding to make it look how I wanted it to look. I also developed some ideas hinted from others surrounding me.</td>

    <td>I think I need to get on with my work better as before my partner left for his music lesson we were talking quite a bit to others and I reckon we could have got in  another project if we did not talk so much. Hopefully I can limit this next lesson.</td>

    <td>Next week I think I need to look at the last page of each project and see what I can alter to get a higher grade and make the coding look better when displayed (e.g. Change the text, Change the colour, Change the paper etc).</td>
