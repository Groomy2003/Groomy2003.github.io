**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today in our lesson we started to plan and create a game that we would like to make on microbit. The key was to not make it too hard otherwise you would never be able to make your game. Unfortunately at first I fell into this trap by trying to create a maze game called 'Maze Runner'. As this was too difficult I ended up making a trivia game on Sport. I really enjoyed this lesson as we were given freedom to what we had to do whereas not being told what to do constantly. I learnt that I should always think through the whole situation before rushing straight into something (eg. making my game nearly impossible for me to create.
