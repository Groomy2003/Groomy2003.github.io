**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today our I.T lesson we first talked about social media and what it was. After a short talk by Mr Keen (our teacher) we were handed a sheet which had some statements on about the subject of social media. We had to go around the class and find a person who has done that statement. We could not ask the same person twice. The winner was the person with the ost lines filled in.

After this we gathered around the whiteboard to watch a video/advert which had been put up by our teacher. The advert was on the company 'KIA' and the advert was about some human sized hamsters who were really fat. But after going to the gym regularly they got thinner and thinner. They were developing. As they arrived in their brand new KIA car to the red carpet they were all wearing tight suits and people were screaming to see them. This advert made you know that the new KIA car had developed loads from the former car just like the hamsters had developed from being fat to being thin. The advert was also very exciting as there was nobody giving a boring speech but just pictures and words. It also caught my eye as you wouldn't see a human sized hamster walking around the streets in day to day life!!!!
