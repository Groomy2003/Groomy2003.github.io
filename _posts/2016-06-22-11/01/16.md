Today was our first lesson back from the Christmas Holidays and this blog post will be my first proper one. In our lesson wen talked about media literacy and what it was. We first started by each receiving a sheet with lots of different sections on media. We had to go around the class trying to find people who had or did the thing that was in the box (eg. 'This person has a Twitter name'.) We also looked through a information sheet on Media Literacy Concepts. These were explained in much more detail. I think I did well in being very diligent and working hard throughout the lesson without messing around. But on the other hand I think I could had read the information sheet for a bit longer because it had a lot of valuable information on it. From this sheet I learnt the when something is advertised the whole story is not told which I was quite surprised with when I read it
