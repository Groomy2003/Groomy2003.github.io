**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today we were looking at media again and we started by looking at any surprises we found when interviewing our parent's (HOMEWORK 4.) After that we looked at personality of people who use social media and how they change when on media a friendly person could be seen as a person who throws a lot of parties and drink a lot of alcohol. We started on a new project which we would have to carry on with over the half term as it would not get finished in the lesson. We had to complete an identity map of of ourselves which I found very interesting. I think I did well in designing my identity Map so it could not just have lots of information on it but also pictures. If I could  repeat this lesson I think I would have tried to be more careful with my colouring in and other things like that. I was amazed by how much I found out about myself while doing this task. I really enjoyed the lesson today.
