**_Our Lesson Today_**

In our lesson today we looked at the advantages and disadvantages of social media as a subject. Each one of us had to go up to the whiteboard and give an opinion(s) of what we think it would be. 

**_Some of the the main points of advantages were:_**

-Having the chance to chat with family and friends that you are not able to talk face to face with.

-Being able to frequently talk to your friends online about life in general. It is also very helpful if you miss a school day as you can ask them what the homework was and what you have to do.

**_Some of the main points of disadvantages were:_**

-If on Facebook or Twitter anyone in the whole world can see your view on something. If you say something that could have offended somebody you could get yourself in a whole lot of trouble.

-People able to spam you and see what you do in your world.

-Sometimes on pictures it shows your location of where you took the picture. Stalkers could easily track down where you are and where your house is. This is very dangerous as they can kill.
