**_How to work to work in Markdown_**

First you need to go onto to somebody's repository and fork it which will be located in the top right hand corner.

Once you have forked the repository it will become yours to edit and do what you want to do on your website. Go on to your forked repository and click the pencil button which enables you to edit the coding.

You can change your avatar bio and lots of other things by using links from the images website. When you are doing this make sure there is a space between the sub-title and what your writing. Don't fill in all the instagram etc bits unless you're planning to get followers out of your website.

After you have done all of that go on to style.scss and play around with the colours and fonts which your website will show. To get a good colour go onto W3schools and pick a colour which you like. To get the link for that colour you need to copy the numbers and letters under the colour which are in binary and paste them in the space back on github.

If you are in any doubt that your website is not working or loading go onto settings and scroll down. You will find a box where it will either say "There is an error on line __" or â€œYour page has successfully been published. 

If by any chance your pager is still not working you will have to go back onto Gabriel where you wrote it and look for any errors. On "Gabriel-The Markdown Angel you are not allowed the same line twice. Keep on planning around until it is working.
