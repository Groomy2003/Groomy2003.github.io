    <td>In second lesson of I.T, I think I worked very well independently, therefore getting very far in the levels on Codecademy. I learnt once again by the instructions and hints given on the website and here is some of the badges I earned:</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to read the instruction more carefully so the code goes into my long term memory rather than my short term so when we go back on it after a week i can remember what I have to do and how to do it throughout the lesson.This will also help me to work independently more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning? Targets?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will probably try to work with the people around a bit more and work together as if I think we had done this, we would have all got a lot further and been a lot more successful with all the levels. This will also be better as we can complete the work quicker and move onto the next section. As well as this I could have talked less to the people around me as this affected my progress. Keep updated for next week's blog!!!
