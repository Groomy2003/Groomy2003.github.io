**_Our Lesson Today_**

Today we carried on the theme of last week which was on the subject of 'Revenge Porn'. Firstly we went into groups of three and discussed what we found out according to the news articles we looked at for our homework. In my opinion tyhe most surprising facts for mr was that there were 1,160 reported incidents of revenge pornography from April 2015 to  December 2015! Mr Keen then gave us more information to gather our knowledge up about this type of stuff. From this lesson I think I did really well in acting sensibly throughout the talk as some people found it all a bit uncomfortable. If we were to do this again I think I could have contributed more to the class about what I found out. Overall I enjoyed this lesson and found it very valuable for the rest of my life.
