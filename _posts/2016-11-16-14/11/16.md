    <td>It's time… For the weekly blog guys!!!!
Today we learnt by using the instruction manuals and following what it said. However, just to make it not so boring we made minor adjustments to the speech my partner and I turned out very funny indeed!</td>

    <td>Today, unfortunately our monitor was not working (DAMMIT!!) so we spent 10 minutes trying to fix it but had no luck. We had to do our work on our teacher's computer. These 10 minutes could have been spent wisely doing some work. What are the chances of our monitor not working?? About a 1 in 30 chance.</td>

    <td>Personally I think this lesson went very well apart what I said just above. I know what you're thinking. How is that possible??? But somehow we did.
Sam and I worked hard and got one of the hardest coding pieces completed which felt really good. And that’s about what we did today.
Have and nice time guys. Peace x.</td>
